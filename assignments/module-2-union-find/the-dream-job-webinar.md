# strategies for finding JD _quickly_

    - like a ice berg: 20% to job market, 80% hidden

    - This is the cycle which co go through every time wheenver there's a vacancy below is the pyramid
    - promotion
        - employee referal
            - network - head of dept, / word of mouth
                - professional org: scaler, conf, 
                    - rec agencies
                        - job portal (top of the pyramid)

what is networking:
    - not emailing random HR
    - identify the right poeople 
    - lead with value: 
    - focus on WIIFM(what's in it for me)

            - best places to work: pay more, best work-life-balance 
                - find in google

                - Cos. entering india - search string in india - search string for google
    - alumni
        - wrong strategy: announcing that you're available
        - type _people_ in linkedin search branches  
            - click _all filters_ on the top
            - professional
                - Current section: company is the one you want to join
                - previous section: your current company 
            - educational 
    - recruiters 
        - itnenal
            - people
        - external

    what to send as a msg
        - how can i contribute to the growth opportunities in your Cos.
            - don't do this: i need a job?
        - Cos. hire *problem solver* not job seekers

# resumes & cover letter, 5th Dec 2024 2030 to 2330

What is covered
 - resume _myths_. following are the myths(meaning, misconception or wrong idea)
    - resume will be read by HR
        - Online resume applications are fed to filtering system called :ATS(applicant trackign system) blocks 90% of resumes
            Why? because, if you look at Job posting on Linked in, it shows no. of applicants(NOTE: if you're using non-premium subscrition, it shows only 'more than 100', otherwise it shows actual no. of applicants), this number quite large for _a_ given position in a Co. and recruiter can't possibly go through 100s of 1000s of resume to pick a candidate. Cos adapt to software that does the filtering for them, may be top 10%, which match their criteria.

    - you need to showcasae all your experience
            - you don't need a linkedin premium to find a Job
            - nobody cares about your experience
            - what they look for is What's in it for me(WIIFM)
            - in few mins, they need to get what can they get out of you
    - led, organized, managed responsible
        - if your resume has such above words, they are called _your inputs_
        - nobody wants to see your inputs, the above are the inputs
            - focus only on _achievements/outcomes_
                - This is a general template to write: "what you achived" followed by "how you achieved" this is how you write
                - you could use achived, succeded, generated, grew and surged, these are the power words
                - refer the _power words_ pdf shared by this course.
                - it is recommended to have numbers(or percentage) to quantify your outcomes
    - What is a resume? resume is _not_ a doc to get a job 
        - Instead, its a _marketing brochure of you_, positioning you as unique, interesting & impressive
        - _aim of resume_ is to get you into the interview room
    - HR reads resume line-by-line
        - recruiters only spend only 7-8 sec looking at a resume
